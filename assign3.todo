assignment 3
part 2 (GAIA querying):
    ✔ download stars from gaia DR3 w/ ADQL @done (9/26/2024, 9:00:45 PM)
    ✔ determine how many stars returned from query @done (9/26/2024, 9:04:17 PM)
    ✔ identify stars where ph_qual != 'AAA' @done (9/26/2024, 9:15:14 PM)
    ✔ identify stars where parallax <= 0 @done (9/26/2024, 9:37:22 PM)
    ✔ remove those problem stars, see how many left @done (9/26/2024, 9:37:24 PM)
    ✔ generate plot (cmds_M67.png, 200dpi): @done (9/26/2024, 9:50:14 PM)
        ✔ color-mag diagram (BP - RP) vs abs G mag @done (9/26/2024, 9:48:49 PM)
            ✔ to get abs G mag: find dist from parallax, get abs mag from apparent mag @done (9/26/2024, 9:48:46 PM)
            ✔ BP-RP is one of the gaia columns already @done (9/26/2024, 9:48:47 PM)
        ✔ 2MASS J-K vs apparent K mag @done (9/26/2024, 9:48:48 PM)
    ✔ fiber usage recommendation @done (10/7/2024, 5:42:03 PM)

part 3 (metallicity plotting):
    ✔ plot log density R vs A(O) w/ linear fit @done (9/26/2024, 3:01:41 PM)
    ✔ plot residuals of R fit @done (9/26/2024, 3:01:42 PM)
    ✔ report intercept + slope for linear fit w/ uncertainties @done (9/26/2024, 3:01:45 PM)
    ☐ discuss results
        ☐ where model fits well
        ☐ RMS / goodness of fit
    ✔ plot xy planes @done (9/26/2024, 3:30:40 PM)
        ✔ median A(O) @done (9/26/2024, 3:01:47 PM)
        ✔ median fitted A(O) @done (9/26/2024, 3:30:35 PM)
        ✔ median residuals @done (9/26/2024, 3:01:48 PM)
    ☐ discuss 2d bin choice (try 3 sets of bins)
        ☐ effects of fewer bins (loses structure)
        ☐ effects of more bins (not enough data in bins)
    ☐ discuss residuals / possible patterns (what does it mean astronomically?)
    ☐ make plots look nicer (standardize labels, etc)
